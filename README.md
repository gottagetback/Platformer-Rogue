Proposed mechanics:  

1. Dynamic Stat Growth (certain stats are increased at the end of the level, depending on the player's actions.)
2. Stat Dependent Randomized Loot (depending on the player's stats, the random loot changes to fit their playstyle.)
3. Procedurally Generated Levels (for gameplay replayability and variety.)
4. Adaptive And Varied Enemy Types (depending on the playstyle, the enemies will have different stats distribution. Ex: a stealth centric player will have to face enemies with higher detection stats.)
6. Unique Boss Mechanics (the boss is designed to be challenging, but fair, allowing players to defeat it in different ways. Ex: a speed player, deals low but fast damage often, while a strenght player waits for opportunities to deal high damage rarely. Defeating the boss for the first time also unlocks permanent new abilities for the player, ex: double jumping, dashing.)
7. Permadeath (on death, the player is sent back to the begining, but is allowed to spend the currency they collected on upgrades for the next run)
8. Hidden Collectibles (hidden treasure that requierss the player to puzzle solve and backtrack)
9. Visual and Audio Cues (for immersion and also as clues for hidden traps or treasures.)
